Dear Admissions Committee,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sivapriya Sugumaran, and I am writing to follow up on my previous email regarding my application for the Master’s in Data Science program at Northeastern University.

I would like to reiterate my sincere interest in joining the program. I understand that my IELTS score of 6.5 is below the preferred requirement, but I truly believe my strong academic record, with a 93% GPA in my undergraduate studies, coupled with my two years of professional experience in Data Science, will allow me to thrive in your rigorous academic environment.

Northeastern University’s reputation for experiential learning and its outstanding industry connections are the main reasons why I have chosen to apply, and I am fully committed to ensuring that my language proficiency meets and exceeds your expectations. I am continuously working on improving my English skills to align with the program’s standards.

Given my passion for Data Science and my strong academic and professional background, I kindly request you to reconsider my application. I am confident that I will contribute positively to the Northeastern community, and I would be truly honored to be part of such a prestigious program.

Please let me know if there are any additional steps or documentation I can provide to support my request.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,
Sivapriya Sugumaran
